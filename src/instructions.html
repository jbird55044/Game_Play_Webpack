    <h1>Jim's Parachute Game</h1>
    <p>This is a knock off of a 1978 arcade game called <i>Skydiver</i> where a plane flies across the screen, and when ready you press the ‘jump’ key to leave the plane aiming for the landing pad below.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The ’jump’ button not only ejects the jumper, but also will also open the chute as the jumper heads down.  The goal is to land on the pad (green bar at the bottom of the screen) waiting as long as you can top open your chute, but not so long that it doesn’t fully deploy.  The later you wait to pull the chute, the more points you get!  Wind changes in both direction and strength which influences the jumper with the chute is deployed.  You can see the weather information from the wind sock at the bottom left.   The wind has logic built in so the direction and gusts are ‘logical’, not random.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once game starts – it’s best to LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS and SPACEBAR for jumper/chute control.   Good luck!</p>
